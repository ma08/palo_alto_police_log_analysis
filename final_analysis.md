# Palo Alto Police Report Analysis - Results

## Analysis Overview
We've analyzed police reports from Palo Alto covering a 30-day period to help identify safer neighborhoods for a family planning to move to the area. Our methodology used both traditional data extraction and vision-based extraction with Claude AI to identify patterns in crime frequency and severity across different streets and neighborhoods.

## Key Findings

### Areas with Lower Safety Concerns
Based on our analysis, these areas had fewer incidents or less severe incident types:

1. **Residential streets away from main thoroughfares**:
   - Forest Ave
   - Cowper St
   - High St
   - Tasso St

2. **Neighborhoods with primarily mental health or non-violent incidents**:
   - Melville Ave area
   - Bryant St area
   - College Ave area

### Areas with More Safety Concerns
These locations had either more incidents or more serious incident types:

1. **University Ave**: The highest number of incidents (4), including both property crimes and disturbances
2. **El Camino Real**: Multiple theft incidents
3. **Middlefield Rd**: Several incidents including mental health calls
4. **Park Blvd**: Higher severity incidents
5. **Alma St**: Moderate number of incidents with mixed severity

### Crime Type Patterns
- **Mental Health (21%)**: Highest percentage of incidents
- **Disturbance (21%)**: Equal to mental health incidents
- **Theft (18%)**: Primarily occurring along commercial corridors
- **Traffic (12%)**: Concentrated on major intersections and thoroughfares
- **Other (9%)**: Miscellaneous incidents
- **Vandalism (6%)**: Sporadic distribution
- **Drugs (6%)**: No clear pattern in distribution
- **DUI/Alcohol (3%)**: Primarily evening incidents
- **Assault (3%)**: Very rare, isolated incidents

## Recommendations for Families

1. **Consider residential side streets** that are set back from major commercial areas like University Ave and El Camino Real

2. **Areas worth exploring**:
   - Forest Ave area (lower incident rate)
   - Cowper St area (primarily non-violent incidents) 
   - Melville Ave/Bryant St area (quieter with lower incident counts)

3. **Areas to potentially avoid or investigate further**:
   - Immediate vicinity of University Ave (highest incident concentration)
   - Sections of El Camino Real with retail (higher theft rates)
   - Park Blvd (some higher-severity incidents)

4. **Consider visibility and activity levels**:
   - Streets with good lighting and moderate foot traffic
   - Areas near schools and community centers (typically lower incident rates)

## Data Limitations

Our analysis has several important limitations to consider:

- Limited to a single 30-day period in April-March 2025
- Some PDF files could not be fully processed due to format issues
- Sample size is relatively small (33-40 incidents total)
- Data extraction had some accuracy challenges with street names
- Not all incidents may be reported to police

## Next Steps

To make a fully informed decision:
- Visit neighborhoods at different times of day
- Speak with local residents about their experiences
- Consider other factors beyond crime (schools, amenities, etc.)
- Look at longer-term crime trends if available
