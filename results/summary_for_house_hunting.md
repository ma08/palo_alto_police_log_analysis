# Palo Alto Safety Analysis for House Hunting

## Key Findings

Based on our analysis of Palo Alto police reports from the past 30 days, here are the key insights to help with your house hunting decision:

### Areas with Lower Safety Concerns
These areas had fewer incidents or less severe incident types:

1. **Areas off main streets**: Many of the smaller streets (like Cowper St, Tasso St, Kipling St) show single incidents and lower safety concern scores
2. **Lower-traffic residential areas**: Streets like Forest Ave, Bryant St, and Melville Ave appear safer

### Areas with More Safety Concerns
These locations had either more incidents or more serious incident types:

1. **University Ave**: Highest number of incidents (4) and highest safety concern score (12.0)
2. **Park Blvd**: Higher severity incidents (including assault)
3. **El Camino Real & Alma St**: Both major thoroughfares with moderate-to-high incident counts

### Crime Types
- Mental Health incidents (7) and general disturbances (7) are the most common incident types
- Theft ranks third (6 incidents)
- Violent crime is rare (only 1 assault in the data)

## Recommendations for Your Family

1. **Consider residential streets**: The data suggests that quieter residential streets away from main commercial corridors tend to have fewer incidents
   
2. **Avoid proximity to University Ave**: This appears to be the area with the highest concentration of incidents, likely due to it being a major commercial corridor

3. **Balance convenience with safety**: Areas like Middlefield Rd have moderate incident counts but are mainly non-violent in nature, which may provide a good balance of accessibility and relative safety

4. **Street-specific insights**:
   - Neighborhoods around Forest Ave, Cowper St, and High St appear to have lower incident rates
   - California Ave area has some incidents but fewer than University Ave
   - Embarcadero Rd and Arastradero Rd each had just one incident reported

5. **Remember data limitations**: This analysis only covers 30 days of incidents, so it provides a snapshot rather than long-term trends. Consider consulting crime maps and speaking with local residents for more comprehensive insights.

Good luck with your house hunting in Palo Alto!
